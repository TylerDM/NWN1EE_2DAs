# NWN1EE_2DAs
The official .2DA's for Beamdog's NWN1:EE

This first commit includes the .2DAs from NWN1:EE dev build 8187 base_2da.bif, plus the two in the override, extracted via the niv's tools found at https://github.com/niv/neverwinter.nim with the command  "nwn_key_unpack /D/Beamdog/00829/data/nwn_base.key /c/Users/myname/dev/NWN1EE_2DAs" .

Perhaps this will be useful for future projects to fork from and compare versions against.
